The Orlando Devs Slack group was formed in January of 2015... and soon after its conception, an anonymous survey was sent out to its ~20 members. A year after, we decided to turn this survey into a yearly tradition and in January of 2016 a second iteration of this survey was completed by approximately 200 anonymous developers.

## Average Salary by Experience

In this graph we broke down average salaries by years of experience. We were surprised to learn just what we expected: the longer you are in the industry, the more money you make.

**What this means to you:** Focus on perfecting your skills; the money will follow.

## Average Salary by Programming Languages

Here we picked the top programming languages within our group. Do look at these numbers with a _grain of salt_ though because of the way this question was asked. Let me explain: We asked individuals to select the programming languages they use daily.

Most individuals in our group selected multiple languages when answering this question. Those who focus on web development for example, may have selected a backend language (ie. Ruby, Java, PHP, etc) in conjunction with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. With this, our average gets a bit more spread out.

What I mean is this: knowing HTML & CSS alone will probably not guarantee you the ~$80K you see in this graph. Also individuals who _only_ do JavaScript daily had an average of ~$97K which is higher than what you see in this graph.

**What this means to you:** Having a diverse knowledge of languages and programming paradigms is still the most effective way of making a good living in our industry. Learning a bit of Java & Python doesn't hurt either ;)

## Average Salary by College Degree

A big question that generally comes up by many individuals is if having a college degree is really worth it in our field. By taking a look at this next graph we'll see that it is possible to make a decent living in our industry by being a self-taught developer. Within are community however, those who did get a Computer Science degree are generally earning more than those who didn't get a degree.

_A word of warning here:_ this graph isn't completely fair by its nature since it doesn't account for experience. As we've seen above, experience is a much stronger defining factor as far as income is concerned. This graph isn't completely fair to those who completed Coding Bootcamps either since the sample size is very small, and those who filled out this survey have not been in the industry for a very long time (again, the graph doesn't account for experience).

**What this means to you:** Getting a college degree is definitely helpful and shouldn't be quickly dismissed. Most developers who filled out this survey however, have not completed a degree related to our industry and are doing pretty well as the graph shows.
